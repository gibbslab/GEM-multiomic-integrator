This repo contains a conglomerate of scripts to integrate proteomic and transcriptomic data based on a genome-scale metabolic model.

# How to use
Here we have two use cases:
1. `astrocyte_contextualization.m` integrates the data to contextualize the Osorio model.
2. `astrocyte_reconstruction.m` recontructs a context-specific model of an astrocyte using Recon3D as the base.

# Articles
Multi-omics integrative analysis coupled to control theory and computational simulation of a genome-scale metabolic model reveal controlling biological switches in human astrocytes under palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity. (submitted)
